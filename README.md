Thanks for checking out the Demo_Projects!  This is a set of examples that
gradually introduce new concepts about programming in Java, all within the very
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that you'll test them out in!  These
project are for VIEWING and EXECUTING (r+x) purposes only, please do not make any
changes to the examples, as it will change for everyone (once I finish writing
them, I'll lock them so they're read-only and can't accidentily get changed).
I encourage you to read each program and try running each one so you can get an
idea of the workings of each one.  You can also copy the source of each example
into your own project so that you can change the code and see what changes what.

That being said, here's an index of the lessons and a short description of each.

    01_HelloWorld/
        
                This is the classic introduction to programming for many
                different programming languages that prints out a simple
                text statement to the screen.
    
    02_Variables/
                
                Introduces the concepts of programming variables.  Includes
                basic type descriptions, declaration/definition, and retrieval.
    
    03_Conditions/
                
                Introduces if, else if, and else statements.  Also briefly
                talks about the ternary operator.
                
    04_Operations/
                
                Operations are actions that are taken on data.  This section
                demonstrates Numerical and Boolean operations that are natively
                supported by Java.
    
    05_Loops/
                
                Often in computing, there are tasks that needs to be run
                repetitively in order to achieve a certain goal.  Loops allow
                programs to repeat an action for as long as needed.
